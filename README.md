# Hello Mate
Let's build some serverless REST APIs with ``Flask``, ``MongoDB Atlas`` and ``AWS``.

To-do: Don't be a minimalist, add more soon.

Usage
-----

* To install all pip dependencies, use:

.. code-block:: python

    hello-mate$ pip install -r requirements.txt

* To run the flask server use:

.. code-block:: python

    $ python app\py\bin\main.py

* There you have it. You'll be able to access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:5001/v1/` by default.
